## InventoryManagement

This program is built and designed using JavaFX to create an inventory management GUI system that allows a user to
add/delete/modify parts or a grouping of parts called a product.

## What I Learned
- Developed a user Interface using JavaFX
- Effectively implemented MVC
- Implemented functionality with a UI allowing users to add/remove/group items
- Implemented functionality that allows a user to search for items using either the item name or a unique ID
- Implemented the GUI using Stack Panes over separate windows just because I had not done it before and wanted to learn something new
- Implemented exception handling to avoid program from crashing due to user input
- How to use dialog boxes while handling exceptions
