## InventoryManagement

This program is built and designed using JavaFX to create an inventory management GUI system that allows a user to
add/delete/modify parts or a grouping of parts called a product.

## What I Learned
- Developed a User Interface using JavaFX
- Effectively implemented MVC setup
- Implemented fuctionality with a UI allowing users to add/remove/group items
- Implemented fuctionality that allows a user to search for items using either the item name or a unique ID
- Implemented the GUI using Stack Panes over seperate windows just because I hadn't done it before and wanted to learn something new 
- Implemented exception hadling to avoid program from crashing due to user input 
- How to use dialoge boxes while handling exceptions
